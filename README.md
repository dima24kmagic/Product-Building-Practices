# Product-Building-Practices
Here I'll describe practices for building a software)

# Waterfall
Building a product using **waterfall** practices include 3 steps (simplify)
* Design
* Build
* Test

Each group of people responsible for a concrete step and poorly communicate between each other,
and that's the main cons using this methodology.

Product might be developed not as it meant to be, and making changes is kinda hard,
because, again, each group working separate from each other.

# Agile

Agile is the methodology for building a product, and main concepts are described here in [**agile manifesto**](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

## Most common Agile variants

1. #### Scrum
> This variant is build up by units of work called **sprint**,
and in there described activities that team wan't to accomplish by the end of it

2. #### Lean and Kanban
> This variants are inspired by methods used in Japanese auto-manufactures to maximize productivity.
They emphasize the **continuous flow of delivery**, with the *team* picking up the item with the next **highest value** for development

3. #### Extreme Programming (XP)
> It's called so, because it's founders proposing **taking the best engineering practices** to the *extreme*
many of this practices popular outside of XP, in example:
> - Pair programming
> - Code review
> - TTD (Test Driven Development)
> - Unit testing

So, agile is focuses on:
* Individuals and interactions within the team
* Measure success by delivering value with working software
* Customer collaboration in the process of development
* Response to change in requirements and priorities
